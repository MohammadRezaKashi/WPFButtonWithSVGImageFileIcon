This WPF project shows how to use a SVG image file as a button Icon. To use of SVG image file I have used of "SharpVectors.Reloaded" package so if you want to use of this project you should install "SharpVectors.Reloaded" NuGet package.
In this Project I have implimmented a WPF style Button and you can change the style.
